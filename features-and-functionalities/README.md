# Airbnb Clone Backend Architecture

## Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the backend architecture for an Airbnb Clone application. The system is designed with scalability, modularity, and security in mind, enabling efficient management of properties, bookings, payments, user interactions, and more. The architecture diagram illustrates the components, their relationships, and the data flow throughout the system.



## Components

### 1. Users & Authentication

- **Guests & Hosts:** Users interact with the system through a user-friendly interface, accessing various functionalities such as property listings, booking, and payment.

- **Auth Service:** Handles authentication using JWT tokens and integrates with third-party OAuth providers (Google, Facebook).

- **User Management Service:** Manages user profiles, including updates and storing profile images in AWS S3.

### 2. Backend Services (Dockerized)

- **Auth Service:** Responsible for user authentication and authorization.

- **User Management Service:** Allows users to manage their profiles, such as updating personal information and profile images.

- **Property Management Service:** Enables hosts to create, update, or delete property listings, including storing property images in AWS S3.

- **Booking Service:** Manages property bookings, ensures availability validation, and prevents double bookings.

- **Payment Service:** Handles payments through Stripe or PayPal, including payouts to hosts and storing transaction records.

- **Review Service:** Allows guests to leave reviews for properties, which are linked to specific bookings.

- **Notification Service:** Sends email notifications (using SendGrid or Mailgun) and in-app alerts for booking confirmations, cancellations, and payment updates.

- **Admin Dashboard Service:** Provides admin control over users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews for monitoring and management purposes.

### 3. Database Layer (PostgreSQL)

- **Users DB:** Stores user information, including guests and hosts.

- **Properties DB:** Stores property details such as title, description, location, and amenities.

- **Bookings DB:** Records all booking details, tracking status such as pending, confirmed, or canceled.

- **Payments DB:** Logs payment transactions, including guest payments and host payouts.

- **Reviews DB:** Stores guest reviews linked to specific bookings.

### 4. File Storage

- **AWS S3:** Stores property images and user profile pictures to reduce the burden on the primary application server and ensure scalability.

### 5. Third-Party Integrations

- **OAuth Providers:** Google and Facebook for social login.

- **Stripe and PayPal:** Secure payment gateways for handling guest payments and host payouts.

- **SendGrid/Mailgun:** For sending email notifications such as booking confirmations, payment updates, etc.

### 6. Security & Monitoring

- **Firewall & Rate Limiting:** Protects the backend services from malicious attacks and ensures the system is not overloaded by excessive requests.

- **Logging & Error Monitoring (Grafana):** Monitors system health, logs errors, and provides dashboards for real-time insights and debugging.

### 7. Caching

- **Redis Cache:** Improves performance by caching frequently accessed data, reducing response times for repeated requests.

## Data Flow Summary

- **User Registration & Login:** Users interact with the Auth Service for authentication, either using email/password or OAuth.

- **Property Management:** Hosts can add or modify property details, with information stored in Properties DB and images saved in AWS S3.

- **Booking System:** Guests can book available properties through the Booking Service, with booking details recorded in Bookings DB.

- **Payment Handling:** Payments are processed through Stripe or PayPal, and records are kept in Payments DB.

- **Review System:** Reviews are linked to completed bookings in the Reviews DB, and hosts can respond to reviews.

## Key Features

- **Scalable Backend Architecture:** Dockerized microservices allow for easy scaling of individual components as needed.

- **Modular Database Layer:** Each core feature has a separate database, improving maintainability and reducing the risk of data corruption.

- **Security First:** Firewalls, rate limiting, and secure authentication mechanisms (JWT and OAuth) ensure that sensitive user data is protected.

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Using Grafana for error logging and monitoring helps ensure uptime and identify issues promptly.
